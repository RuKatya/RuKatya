## Hello ðŸ‘‹

My name is Katya and I have completed a full stack course :woman_student: . 

During the course I learned a lot of tools with which I can create a website, such as: React | NextJS | NodeJS | MongoDB. 
Of course I also have the basics in HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

:technologist: I am currently working on some personal projects where I can present my knowledge, strengthen myself in things I think I am still weak and at the same time learn new material that I did not get to learn during the course, such as React native.

I invite you to visit my [ :globe_with_meridians: Portfolio page](https://katya-ru-fullstack.herokuapp.com/) and be impressed by it.

:email: **Don't hesitate to ask questions, I will always be happy to help! You can to contact me via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/katya-rukosuev/) or [Email](mailto:katya.ru.fullstack@gmail.com).**

**P.S.** ðŸ˜„ Fun fact about me  - I want to buy a house just to have a lot of plants in it.
