## Hello ðŸ‘‹

My name is Katya and I have completed a full stack course :woman_student: . 

During the course I learned a lot of tools with which I can create a website, such as: React | NextJS | NodeJS | MongoDB. 
Of course I also have the basics in HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

:technologist: I am currently working on some personal projects where I can present my knowledge, strengthen myself in things I think I am still weak and at the same time learn new material that I did not get to learn during the course, such as React native.

I invite you to visit my [ :globe_with_meridians: Portfolio page](https://katya-ru-fullstack.herokuapp.com/) and be impressed by it.

**P.S.** ðŸ˜„ Fun fact about me  - I loves an anime by Studio Ghibli.
